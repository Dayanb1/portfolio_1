    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Dayanand N Bhivase ‚Äî a passionate and curious problem-solver with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I specialize in turning real-world challenges into smart, scalable tech solutions. From building IoT-based energy dashboards and smart door locks, to exploring cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, I love blending hardware with software.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey includes internships in AWS IoT, Azure IoT, and even 3D printing, along with hands-on projects using Raspberry Pi, Python, and REST APIs. I'm now transitioning into full-stack software development, constantly expanding my skills in frontend tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend logic, and cloud deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm not just writing code ‚Äî I‚Äôm crafting experiences, solving problems, and building my future one line at a time. Whether it‚Äôs a Python script, an Android app, or a cloud-connected IoT solution, I bring energy, adaptability, and dedication to everything I build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs build something impactful together. üöÄ
